    "# Machine Learning: Week 6 - Advice for Applying Machine Learning\n",
    "## Deciding What to Try Next\n",
    "Errors in your predictions can be troubleshooted by:\n",
    "- Getting more training examples\n",
    "- Trying smaller sets of features\n",
    "- Trying additional features\n",
    "- Trying polynomial features\n",
    "- Increasing or decreasing $\\lambda$\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t just pick one of these avenues at random. We’ll explore diagnostic techniques for choosing one of the above solutions in the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluating a Hypothesis\n",
    "A hypothesis may have a low error for the training examples but still be inaccurate (because of overfitting). Thus, to evaluate a hypothesis, given a dataset of training examples, we can split up the data into two sets: a **training set** and a **test set**. Typically, the training set consists of $70\\%$ of your data and the test set is the remaining $30\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new procedure using these two sets is then:\n",
    "- Learn $\\Theta$ and minimize $J_{train}(\\Theta)$ using the training set\n",
    "- Compute the test set error $J_{test}(\\Theta)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The test set error\n",
    "1. For linear regression: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    "J_{test}( \\Theta ) =\\frac{1}{2m_{test}}\\sum _{i=1}^{m_{test}}\\left( h_{\\Theta }\\left( x_{test}^{( i)}\\right) \\ -\\ y_{test}^{( i)}\\right)^{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For classification ~ Missclassification error (aka $0/1$ misclassification error):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    "err( h_{\\Theta }( x) ,y) =\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1\\ \\ \\ if\\ \\ h_{\\Theta }( x) \\geqslant 0.5\\ \\ and\\ \\ y=0\\ \\ or\\ \\ h_{\\Theta }( x) < 0.5\\ \\ and\\ \\ y=1\\\\\n",
    "0\\ otherwise\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a binary $0$ or $1$ error result based on a misclassification. The average test error for the test set is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    "Test\\ Error=\\frac{1}{m_{test}}\\sum _{i=1}^{m_{test}} err\\left( h_{\\Theta }\\left( x_{test}^{( i)}\\right) ,y_{test}^{( i)}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the proportion of the test data that was misclassified."
