# Week 6
## Advice for Applying Machine Learning
In Week 6, you will be learning about systematically improving your learning algorithm. The videos for this week will teach you how to tell when a learning algorithm is doing poorly, and describe the _**'best practices'**_ for how to _**'debug'**_ your learning algorithm and go about improving its performance.

We will also be covering machine learning system design. To optimize a machine learning algorithm, youâ€™ll need to first understand where the biggest improvements can be made. In these lessons, we discuss how to understand the performance of a machine learning system with multiple parts, and also how to deal with skewed data.

When you're applying machine learning to real problems, a solid grasp of this week's content will easily save you a large amount of work.
